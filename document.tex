\chapter*{Preface}
This document template conforms to Guide to Writing a Thesis at
Tampere University of Technology (2014) and is based on the previous
template. The main purpose is to show how the theses are formatted
using LaTeX (or \LaTeX ~ to be extra fancy) .

The thesis text is written into file \texttt{d\_tyo.tex}, whereas
\texttt{tutthesis.cls} contains the formatting instructions. Both
files include lots of comments (start with \%) that should help in
using LaTeX. TUT specific formatting is done by additional settings on
top of the original \texttt{report.cls} class file. This example needs
few additional files: TUT logo, example figure, example code, as well
as example bibliography and its formatting (\texttt{.bst}) An example
makefile is provided for those preferring command line. You are
encouraged to comment your work and to keep the length of lines
moderate, e.g. <80 characters. In Emacs, you can use \texttt{Alt-Q} to
break long lines in a paragraph and \texttt{Tab} to indent commands
(e.g. inside figure and table environments). Moreover, tex files are
well suited for versioning systems, such as Subversion or Git.  
% \url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf}


Acknowledgements to those who contributed to the thesis are generally
presented in the preface. It is not appropriate to criticize anyone in
the preface, even though the preface will not affect your grade. The
preface must fit on one page. Add the date, after which you have not
made any revisions to the text, at the end of the preface.

% Tilde ~ makes an non-breakable spce in LaTeX. Here it is used to get
% two consecutive paragraph breaks

 \subsection {Comparing Testbench with other tools}
    Here I will compare testbench to some other testing tools for example
    Selenium, what are benefits of using Testbench. The main idea is to focus
    that Vaadin is a client-server framework, so all Vaadin components have
    client and server side code, and it's important to test both. I want to show
    what problems may happen if using only Selenium and test only client side
    code, so that server side isn't tested. 
    
    Also I would like to compare how complicated is to right Selenium and
    Testbench tests. How much code is needed to test button click for example,
    or sending text to a textField.
    
    Compare speed of running tests. In Vaadin we run tests every night, and
    sometimes it takes too much time, so I would like to mention ,what are the
    problems/challenges in having a lot of tests.

      
 \subsection {Vaadin integration}
    Testbench using some features of Vaadin framework, for example searching
    elements by vaadin selectors. So I want to describe how integration with
    Vaadin is done. What are the challenges. For example what would happen when
    using different versions of Testbench with different versions of Vaadin.
