\chapter {Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}
	
In the master thesis we have shown what are the complications about testing and
testing Vaadin applications. We have described different C\&R test and
programmable tests, and justify that programmable tests provide several
advantages.

Presenting Selenium testing framework we have shown why a Vaadin Testbench
should be developed.

After six weeks of development our team Testbench 4.0.0 released in December
2014. Testbench is used both during Vaadin framework development and during development Web applications
based on Vaadin framework. The biggest advantage of Testbench against other testing frameworks 
that it is designed specifically for testing Vaadin applications.

 User case studies have shown, that a Java or Vaadin expert Vaadin,
 without any experience using Testbench, needs 15 minutes to setup the
 environment and run a simple test.
 
 A Vaadin Testbench is a commercial product and distributed via CVAL3 license,
 nevertheless every one can see try it during 30 days trial period.
